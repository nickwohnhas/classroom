This application offers a way for Teachers to sign up, create courses, and grade the students enrolled in their courses.  Students can choose from existing courses and enroll in them.

To get started, fork and clone this repo.

Once in the root directory, run bundle install, followed by 'rake db:migrate'.

Running 'rails s' in your terminal will allow you to visit http://localhost:3000

From there you can choose your role as either a teacher or student.  To update a student's grade, click on the letter grade.
